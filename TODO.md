# Meltwater TODO list

## Short term

## Medium term

* Implement GUI

* Implement resampling

## Long term

* Implement other audio degradation methods.
  For example, a simulated sigma-delta ADC/DAC pair, with variable
  intermediate sample rate (and 1-bit depth), could be interesting

* Add delay option so this can be used as a lo-fi delay, not just a lo-fi processor
